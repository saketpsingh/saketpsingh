## 📝 My Blogs

Welcome to my blog! Below are some of my recent blog posts:

### [1. Troubleshooting Docker Container Problems](https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/04/25/troubleshooting-docker-container-problems/)

Several factors could cause Sitecore containers running on Docker to stop functioning or display as unhealthy containers. To troubleshoot or fix the errors, we ran into a few Docker container issues, which we have listed in the blog.

### [2. Troubleshooting Docker Container Problems Part 2](https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/04/25/troubleshooting-docker-container-problems-part-2/)

We discussed a few Docker problems in the Troubleshooting Docker Container Problems article with its solutions. We will discuss several other Sitecore docker issues in this article.

### [3. Migrating Docker Compose from V1 to V2 Code Details](https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/07/03/migrating-docker-compose-from-v1-to-v2-code-details/)

In this article, we are going to see step-by-step code changes required to migrate docker-compose from v1 to v2.

### [4. Troubleshooting Sitecore Image Update Issue](https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/11/15/troubleshooting-sitecore-image-update-issue/)

Troubleshooting image update issues in Sitecore can prove to be a complex task, as various factors could contribute to the problem. We recently encountered an issue where, after updating the “Sitecore Images,” our local project instance stopped working.

### [5. Bypassing the PowerShell File Import Issue](https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/12/05/bypassing-the-powershell-file-import-issue/)

The PowerShell file import script was working correctly on the local project instance, but it failed to work when deployed to other higher environments and with this approach, it allows us to get around the PowerShell file import issue and gives the user the ability to choose which exact file needs to be imported.
